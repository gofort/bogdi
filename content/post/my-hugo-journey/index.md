Wow! My First Post!

Hi once again!

I have created this small post in learning purposes. I am trying to discover Hugo possibilities :)

Some notes based on some days of digging:

1. Dirs structure

```
* content
  * post
    * <post-name>
      * index.md
      * cover.jpg
  * page
    * about.md
    * archives.md
    * search.md
* assets
  * img
    * avatar.jpg
```

2. Post annotations

```
