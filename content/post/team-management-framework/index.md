## Goals of this page

- Spend less time to make decisions as a manager
- Be confident in my decisions
- Manage teams in a structured way without loosing something important
- Share knowledge to raise other managers
- To improve my skills

## Framework

- Culture Code
    - Mission Statement (Purpose)
        - What is it: Statement of why an organization exists, what its overall goal is
        - Examples:
            - Cloudflare: Build better internet
            - Microsoft: To empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more
            - Amazon: To continually raise the bar of the customer experience by using the internet and technology to help consumers find, discover and buy anything, and empower businesses and content creators to maximise their success
            - IKEA: To create a better everyday life for the many people
    - Values
        - What is it: Decision-making guide and a sense of what’s important and what’s right
        - What I value
            - Transparency
                - Why? No transparency = No trust = Bad decisions = Not efficient work
            - Autonomy (Ownership)
                - Why? Less autonomy = More exhausiting processes = Less flexible organization
            - Metrics
                - Why? In my experience this is the most straightforward way to request resources or to understand hapiness level in a company
- People Management
    - Hiring new people
        - Process
            - Before the interview: Create a meeting with a team to decide what hard skills you require and what questions can help us to understand if this person have such skills or not
            - First interview: screening with HR to understand cultural fit
            - Second interview: technical part with one of team members
            - Ask yourself questions
                - Do you want this person to work with you every day?
                - Can you learn something new from this person?
        - Principles
            - Hire awesome people, or don’t hire at all
        - Ideal Team Player by Patric Lensioni
            - Humble - They lack excessive ego or concerns about status. They are quick to point out the contributions of others and slow to seek recognition for their own. They share credit, emphasize team over self, and define success collectively rather than individually.
            - Hungry - They are always looking for more—more things to do, more to learn, more responsibility. Hungry people rarely have to be pushed by a manager to work harder because they are self-motivated and diligent. They are constantly thinking about the next step and the next opportunity.
            - Smart - They are emotionally intelligent and have common sense about people. They tend to know what is happening in a group situation and how to effectively deal with others. They have good judgment and intuition around the subtleties of group dynamics and the impact of their words and actions.
    - Career development / Mentoring
        - How to define what to learn? - Create competency matrix like this [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_T5fkUrKJ8lxW0OFVNJ-Z24vkvS6pHpZ8rgBtMTLF6E/edit#gid=15](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_T5fkUrKJ8lxW0OFVNJ-Z24vkvS6pHpZ8rgBtMTLF6E/edit#gid=15)
        - How to constantly learn?
            - Regularly at the same time: Give 1 day in 2 weeks to the whole team to develop skills from competency matrix and ask them to write what they will learn today in public channels
            - Regularly, but at random time: Create learning task which can be prioritized during the sprint
    - Salary increase
        - One way
            - Create a line (scale with salary 0$→1000$) with all people on it and check its impact based on person role and responsibilities
            - If you see that impact is not enough ⇒ Describe what to change
            - if you see this is enough ⇒ Raise salary
        - Second way
            - You have a min and a max amount of money you can pay for every position, so firstly you can increase salary bigger because person learned a lot and after this you can increase salary not too fast for this person. For every outstanding behavior you can pay extra money, but don't change salary.

    - Managing Low Performers
        - How to define low performer among programmers?
            - A lot of comments in PRs
            - Negative feedback from peers
            - Long PRs
            - More incidents or errors in production comparing to others
            - Unnecessarily complex architecture
            - Asks few questions
        - What we can do with this?
            - Understand root cause via providing feedback and ask what we can do with this?
            - Set clear expectations if they are not set already
            - Set deadline to change behavior
            - Ask colleagues to give direct feedback if they have not done so
            - Make a decision
    - Motivate (Dealing with procrastination)
        - Motivation for people whose work related to a lot of thinking and creativity: autonomy (be self directed), mastery (be a master in something) and purpose (from Daniel Pink book); Motivation with money decrease their performance, see [https://blog.crisp.se/2012/01/11/anderslaestadius/stop-using-differentiated-salaries](https://blog.crisp.se/2012/01/11/anderslaestadius/stop-using-differentiated-salaries)), you need to pay them enough and give them these three components.

    - Promotion
        - Firstly, you should have an opened position where everybody can apply to. You can't promote somebody because you like him. After this you announce new position and tell everybody that they can apply.

    - Give correct feedback
        - Candid - don't lie, it is the worst thing you can do
        - Specific - have a verifiable evidence which is available for both to check (because people can argue)
        - Actionable - define specific actions to do better next time
        - Timely - don't wait to give a feedback, it can become irrelevant
        - Judgement-free - don't use words like: bad, the worst, crap, etc.
        - Safe - try to make it softer, not to offend a person
        - Direct - don't pass your feedback through third parties, tell it directly to a person who is intended to receive it
