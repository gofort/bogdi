I like minimalism in my life and of course it affects my working desk. I think it is much easier to focus on what matters when you don't have some useless stuff on your desk. At the same time it can indicate that if your desk is empty it means that you have too much time and don't know how to use it bringing more value, but who cares, I like this :)

### Benefits of uncluttered desk

* Easier to focus
* Easier to clean
* Portable setup

### Disadvantages

* Small screen

### What do I have here

* **Macbook Air**
  * The best laptop I have ever used, it is portable and pretty fast for my tasks, what else do I need?
* **Notebook**
  * Useful to work on articles and books, when you need not only to read and forget, but think about what is written there
* **Pretty old Jabra headset**
  * Don't have any reason to change this to something new, it just works
* **Kindle Paperwhite**
  * Very convenient to send books to this device, but not sure that it is the best thing to read non-fiction books
* **Airpods**
  * I have forgotten to put them on the desk haha, but they are always there, because it is the best device for remote meetings

### Bonus

You can see one of the cheapest IKEA chairs here and maybe you think, why you don't care about your posture and spine? But the thing is that you don't need very expensive chair to sir correctly and prevent pain in your spine.
