Sometimes I hear the same question from different developers which sounds like this: "How to understand that I have grown or not since previous year?". It was a good question and I have not worked at a company which could give me an answer to this. Moreover systems which I saw in other companies (mosty outsource) were aimed at developing hard skills, but what about soft skills?

### Why hard skills are not enough to grow as a software engineer

* Time management helps you to find time to learn
* Fighting procrastination gives you more free time and helps you to start learning
* Decomposition forces you to dig deeper into any aspect of the problem and you know exactly what hard skill you need to improve

### Metrics I decided to use

* Decomposition
  * Number of merged pull requests per month (target value: >= 5)
    * Decomposition of tasks and code you write. It is important, because it is much easier to make deep and quality code review if pull request is short. Moreover, it is easier to stay organized and don't forget anything important during implementation of big functionality, because you are focused on some small piece of your task.

* Time management / Organizational skill
  * 50 percentile (Time in hours since joined as reviewer till first approve or reject) per month (target value: <= 4h)
    * How organized are you. If pull requests wait for your review for a long time it means that you are not good at managing your time and you can't find time or forget about reviewing.

* Code review quality
  * Rejects / (Approves + Rejects) per month (target value: <= 30%)
    * Every time during code review you need to make a decision - to approve or to reject. If in 100% you click approve - it means that you can't make code review deep enough and with enough quality. At the same time you should understand that rejects are normal and every reject is an opportunity for another person to grow and make their pull request better.

* Open Source contributions
  * Number of created issues + number of pull requests in public Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab/etc. per month (target value: >= 3)
    * Professional developers contribute to open source and develops IT industry by their contribution. This also helps to build personal brand.

* Ability to communicate your thoughts clearly
  * Number of md files created or changed + number of schemas drawn + number of wiki files created or changed + number of jira tasks described in detail per month (target value: >= 3)
    * Software engineering is about working in a team. You can't build something outstanding alone. To work in a team effectively you need to communicate your thoughts clearly mostly using text and diagrams. The main emphasis is on text communication, because only this type of communication can create artifacts which other people can work with. Ideal situation is when you have not spoken to another developer at all, but he can make a small fix in your application for less than 2 hours. Note: slack communication creates artifacts which are hardly searchable, so we don't count it.

* Presenting to the public
  * Number of Education Day presentations + Number of technical articles + Number of tech talks in public communities per quarter (target value: >= 1)
    * Professional developers not only write code, but share their knowledge with wider audience thereby influencing the industry and developing a personal brand. As an example you can look at companies like Cloudflare, Uber, Facebook which create their own technical blogs.

P.S. Education Day - something like meetup on Friday at company where I work.

### What to do with cheating

The only way you can prevent cheating is awareness. Any cheating on these metrics hurts the measured person and shows illusion of growth. Try to explain that software engineers needs this more than you (and by the way this is truth).

### Why you need to measure it

Because in other case it is impossible to understand if you have grown or not.

### Conclusion

As I see in real life this approach gives positive results. Firslty, code review became much interesting than it was, because team members decline pull requests and they need to negotiate each time growing their soft and technical skills during negotiation. Secondly, they started to think more that their team members are waiting for their review, so time management skills improved. Thirdly, now they think about size of their pull requests, they understand that it is not cool to review something big, because it is hard. To conclude, it helped them to grow and this was our goal, so let's celebrate :)
